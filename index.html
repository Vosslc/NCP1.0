            <h1>What is beer Ipsum?</h1>
            <h1>Why do we use it?</h1>
            <p>The slurly miserly Lone Star hesitates, because a grizzly beer teaches a ridiculously precise air hocky table. Most people believe that a keg defined by a Busch is a big fan of a Hazed and Infused living with some Bridgeport ESB, but they need to remember how secretly a corona light starts reminiscing about a lost buzz. Furthermore, a bullfrog brew rejoices, and a gratifying Sierra Nevada Pale Ale slurly gives a stink finger to some childlike Avery IPA. When a Jamaica Red Ale related to the Busch starts reminiscing about a lost buzz, an Avery IPA inside a wanker dies. The flirty ice house reads a magazine, and a Busch reads a magazine; however, another wastedly muddy Lone Star can be kind to a Lone Star.
            <br><br>
            Out of the 12oz bottle, the beer pours a bright, rich amber colored brew, tainted by a touch of haze and topped with an appealing two-finger, white, creamy foam head. Fresh, powdery grist, some must, and hints of fruity esters in the nose. Near medium in body, relatively smooth on the palate, but a scrubbing carbonation breaks things up. Crisp, for a moment. Raw leafy hop tannic feel on the palate segues to a thin, watery, citric-like bitterness. Mineral flavors come to play. Malt flavors seem a bit masked at first, but there's a malt presence that provides some backing for everything else, with some apple-y fruitiness beneath. That said, as the beer warms a round and sweet caramel and toasty malty note emerges, along with some earthy and woody suggestions, but alas it's towards the end of the beer. Finishes dry with a mineral linger and sweet edges.
